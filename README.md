# hi, i'm ilan! 🙋🏽‍♂️

i'm a builder and reader based ins sf. i hack on developer tools, scattered projects, and canonical interfaces (visual & otherwise).

## hours of scripting can save you minutes of manual labor...

...but hundreds of hours for everyone else.

i mean, that's not why i do it. it's just fun. but it's a great way to justify it :)
